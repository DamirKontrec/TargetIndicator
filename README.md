# Target Indicator
A simple JavaSript control for visualizing donation data. The widget displays the amount of money donated to a certain cause, and the remaining sum, in form of a progress bar. 

JavaScript code uses jQuery library as it's dependency. The widget was recreated to look exactly like a provided screenshot using only CSS (no images were used), resulting in a scalable UI.
